          <h1>AMAR MAHAL MUSEUM</h1>
          <p>
            The Amar Mahal Palace is a palace in Jammu, in the Indian erstwhile Kingdom of Jammu and Kashmir, India. The
            palace has now been converted into a museum. Commissioned by Maharaja Amar Singh, a Dogra king, the palace
            was built in the nineteenth century by a French architect on the lines of a French Chateau. The palace was
            donated to the Hari-Tara Charitable Trust by Karan Singh for use as a museum. It has many exhibits including
            a golden throne weighing 120kg, a Pahari miniature, Kangra miniature paintings, a library of 25,000 antique
            books, many rare art collections, and a large collection of portraits of the royal family.

            The palace was the last official residence of the Dogra dynasty and the last king of the kingdom Maharaja
            Hari Singh.

          <h1>HISTORY</h1>
          <p>
            The Amar Mahal Palace was planned by a French architect, in 1862. However, it was not built until the 1890s.
            Maharani Tara Devi, wife of the late Maharaja Hari Singh (son of Raja Amar Singh) lived in this palace till
            her death in 1967. Subsequently, her son Karan Singh and his wife Yasho Rajya Lakshmi converted the palace
            into a museum to house rare books and works of art, with the objective of "Encouraging artistic talent, to
            establish fine arts centre and to collaborate with other like minded institutions for promotion of Indian
            arts". For this purpose, they transferred the palace property to a trust named as the "Hari-Tara Charitable
            Trust". Karan Singh voluntarily surrendered the Privy Purse paid to him by the Government of India as a
            former ruler of Jammu, one of the Princely state of India, and used the funds to set up this museum named in
            memory of his parents.

            The museum was inaugurated by the Indira Gandhi, Prime Minister of India, on 13 April 1975. To promote the
            stated objectives, the Trust arranges guided tours, book readings, lectures, film shows and hobby classes
            and other visitor friendly activities in the Museum. Scholarly exchanges, workshops and exhibitions are also
            regular features held by the Trust. The Dogra-Pahari paintings displayed in the museum were creation of the
            second half of the 18th century in Jammu and Himachal Pradesh of the Kangra school of art. To quote the
            words of Karan Singh: "The whole effect is to transport one into a fascinating miniature world with its own
            aura and ethos.
          </P>
          <h1>GEOGRAPHY</h1>
          <P>
            The palace built in red sandstone with red bricks is in a picturesque environment on a hillock overlooking
            the Tawi river valley. Built in the European castle style, the palace has sloping roofs with turrets and
            tall towers. When built during the reign of Raja Amar Singh, it was the tallest building in Jammu. The
            imposing building has long passages on three sides, which are covered by sloping corrugated tin roofs. The
            passages are supported on columns with wooden framework. The first floor of the palace building has French
            windows with connected balcony. The top floor has a bay window. The windows also depict triangular
            projections in classical Greek architectural style, which are fitted over ornate false columns.

          <p>
            Only four rooms of the palace are open depicting Pahari paintings of Mahabharata epic scenes and royal
            memorabilia. A golden sofa of the Dogra rulers, weighing 120 kg in pure gold, embedded with golden lions at
            the corners, is housed in a hexagonal room in the museum, which is viewed only through glass covered window
            panes as the main door is kept locked for security reasons. The art works of some of the renowned Indian
            artists like M.F. Hussain, J.Swaminathan, G. R. Santosh, Bikash Battacharjee, Ram Kumar, Laxman Pai are also
            on display in the museum.[9] In one of the galleries, paintings of Hindu epic stories such as of Nala
            Damayanti (a set of forty-seven miniature paintings) are depicted. Modern version of the Dashavatara
            paintings (ten avatars of Hindu god Vishnu) are also displayed in a separate ante-chamber in the Museum.
            These are unusual modern art set of paintings. Family portraits of the Dogra rulers of Jammu and Kashmir are
            on display in the Durbar Hall at the entrance gallery. In the first and second floors, a few chambers house
            the library, which has a collection of rare antique books (25,000) on religion, philosophy and political
            science to fiction.

            An exclusive chamber in the museum, once the living quarters of the Maharani (later called the Maharajmata)
            Tara Devi, is conserved and exhibited in its original form where a silver bedspread, period furniture,
            photographs, the decoration of the Crown of India which was presented to her in 1945, her personal items of
            clothing and the unique Victorian bath room are on display.
