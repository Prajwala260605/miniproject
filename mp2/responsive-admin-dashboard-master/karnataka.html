            The Visvesvaraya Industrial and Technological Museum (VITM), Bangalore, India, a constituent unit of the
            National Council of Science Museums (NCSM), Ministry of Culture, Government of India, was established in
            memory of Sir M. Visvesvaraya. The 4,000 m2 (43,000 sq ft) building was constructed in Cubbon Park, and was
            inaugurated by the first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, on July 14, 1962. The museum
            displays industrial products, scientific models and engines.

          <h1>HISTORY</h1>
          <p>Honoring Sir M. Visvesvaraya, the All India Manufacturers Organization and Mysore State Board decided to
            create a science and technology museum in Bangalore. The foundation stone was laid by Shri B. D. Jatti,
            Chief Minister of Mysore, on 15 September 1958. The Visvesvaraya Industrial Museum Society (VIMS) came to be
            registered as the nodal agency in order to pool resources from various industrial houses. It was inaugurated
            by the first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, on July 14, 1962.[1]

            The first exhibition, 'Electricity', was opened to the public on July 27, 1965.[2]

            In the year 1970, VITM launched the Mobile/Moving Science Exhibition (MSE) with 24 participatory exhibits
            mounted on a bus. The MSE Bus travels throughout Southern India.

            In 1978, many science museums, including VITM, parted from CSIR and were brought under a newly formed
            society registered on 4 April 1978 as National Council of Science Museums (NCSM). In 1979 an extension was
            added to the building, increasing the total area of the museum to 6,900 m2 (74,000 sq ft).

            NCSM set up three additional science centers at Gulbarga (Karnataka) in 1984, Tirunelveli (Tamil Nadu) in
            1987, Tirupati (Andhra Pradesh)in 1993 and at Kozhikode, Kerala in 1997, which are functioning under the
            direct administrative control of VITM. Thus, VITM has become the southern zone headquarters of NCSM.
