            Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya, (CSMVS) originally named Prince of Wales Museum of Western
            India, is a museum in Mumbai (Bombay) which documents the history of India from prehistoric to modern times.

            It was founded during British rule of India in the early years of the 20th century by prominent citizens of
            the city then called Bombay, with the help of the government, to commemorate the visit of the Prince of
            Wales (later George V, king of the United Kingdom and emperor of India). It is located in the heart of South
            Mumbai near the Gateway of India. The museum was renamed in 1998 after Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the
            founder of the Maratha Empire.

            The building is built in the Indo-Saracenic style of architecture, incorporating elements of other styles of
            architecture like the Mughal, Maratha and Jain. The museum building is surrounded by a garden of palm trees
            and formal flower beds.

            The museum houses approximately 50,000 exhibits of ancient Indian history as well as objects from foreign
            lands, categorised primarily into three sections: Art, Archaeology and Natural History. The museum houses
            Indus Valley civilization artefacts, and other relics from ancient India from the time of the Guptas,
            Mauryas, Chalukyas and Rashtrakuta.

          <h1>HISTORY</h1>
          <p>
            In 1904, some leading citizens of Bombay decided to provide a museum to commemorate the visit of the Prince
            of Wales, the future King George V. On 14 August 1905, the committee passed a resolution saying:


            'Statue of The Prince of Wales, who became the Emperor, George Vth, later
            "The museum building embodies the pomp and height at which the British raj was moving ahead with their
            ambitious plans, in building the great metropolis Bombay". "In keeping pace with the best style of local
            architecture, many buildings were built, among which, Bombay High Court building, and later, Gateway of
            India buildings were the most notable ones".


            On two sides of the statue has mural type of stone carving depicting the POW inaugurating the museum
            The foundation stone was laid by the Prince of Wales on 11 November 1905 and the museum was formally named
            "Prince of Wales Museum of Western India". On 1 March 1907, the government of the Bombay Presidency granted
            the museum committee a piece of land called the "Crescent Site", where the museum now stands. Following an
            open design competition, in 1909 the architect George Wittet was commissioned to design the Museum building.
            Wittet had already worked on the design of the General Post Office and in 1911 would design one of Mumbai's
            most famous landmarks, the Gateway of India.

            The museum was funded by the Royal Visit (1905) Memorial Funds. Additionally, the Government and the
            Municipality granted Rs. 300,000 and Rs. 250,000 respectively. Sir Currimbhoy Ibrahim (first Baronet)
            donated another Rs. 300,000 and Sir Cowasji Jehangir gave Rs. 50,000. The Museum was established under
            Bombay Act No. III of 1909. The museum is now maintained by annual grants from the Government and the Bombay
            Municipal Corporation. The latter pays for these grants from the interest accruing on the funds at the
            disposal of the Trust of the Museum.

            The museum building was completed in 1915, but was used as a Children's Welfare Centre and a Military
            Hospital during the First World War, before being handed over to the committee in 1920. The Prince of Wales
            Museum was inaugurated on 10 January 1922, by Lady Lloyd, the wife of George Lloyd, Governor of Bombay.

            The museum building is a Grade I Heritage Building of the city and was awarded first prize (Urban Heritage
            Award) by the Bombay Chapter of the Indian Heritage Society for heritage building maintenance in 1990. In
            1998 the Museum was renamed Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya after the warrior king and
            founder of the Maratha Empire, Shivaji. The museum was renamed after the renaming of the city in 1995, when
            the colonial name "Bombay" was replaced by the native "Mumbai".

          <h1>ARCHITECTURE</h1>
          <p>
            The museum building is situated in 3 acres (12,000 m2) area, having a built up area of 12,142.23m sq. It is
            surrounded by a garden of palm trees and formal flower beds.

            The museum building, built of locally quarried grey Kurla basalt and buff coloured trachyte Malad stone. It
            is a three-storied rectangular structure, capped by a dome set upon a base, which adds an additional storey
            in the centre of the building. Built in the Western Indian and Indo-Saracenic style of architecture, the
            building accommodates a central entrance porch, above which rises a dome, tilled and modified well "tiled in
            white and blue flecks, supported on a lotus - petal base". A cluster of pinnacles, topped with miniature
            domes surround the central dome. The building incorporates features like Islamic dome with a finial along
            with protruding balconies and inlaid floors, inspired by Mughal palace architecture. The architect, George
            Wittet, modelled the dome on that of Golconda Fort and the inner vaulting arches on those at the Gol Gumbaz
            in Bijapur. The interior of the museum combines the columns, railings and balcony of an 18th-century Wada (a
            Maratha mansion) with Jain style interior columns, which form the main body of the central pavilion below
            the Maratha balcony.

            In its recent modernisation programme (2008), the museum created 30,000 sq ft (2,800 m2) space for
            installation of five new galleries, a conservation studio, a visiting exhibition gallery and a seminar room,
            in the East Wing of the Museum. The museum also houses a library.

          <h1>SCULPTURE GALLERY</h1>
          <div>
            <P>The archaeological collections were originally started by pioneering archaeologists Sir Henry Cousens and
              Sir John Marshall. Amongst the important sculptures are the Gupta period terracottas and bricks from
              Mirpurkhas excavated by Cousens, a large number of Buddhist images from Gandhara and ceiling panels from a
              dilapidated temple at Aihole. The early examples are from Pauni and Pitalkhora. Mumbai itself has a rich
              tradition exemplified by the colossal Parel Relief of Shiva (represented here by a cast) and a Matrika
              from Baijanath Temple at Sewri near Parel belonging to the same phase as Elephanta. Other noteworthy
              images from Maharashtra are a Vishnu and a Ganesha of the eleventh century CE. Some well known sculptures
              are:

              Brahma, from Elephanta Caves
              Mahishasuramardini, from Elephanta
              Parel Relief of Shiva (plaster cast) from Parel
              Sculptures from Aihole and Pattadakal
              Dvarapala, from Shamalji, Gujarat
              Garuda, from the Konark Sun Temple
              Yaksha, from Pitalkhora
