          <h1>INDIAN MUSEUM</h1>
          <p>
            The Indian Museum (formerly called Imperial Museum of Calcutta before independence,) is a massive museum in
            Central Kolkata, West Bengal, India. It is the ninth oldest museum in the world and the oldest and largest
            museum in India and Asia, by size of collection. It has rare collections of antiques, armour and ornaments,
            fossils, skeletons, mummies and Mughal paintings. It was founded by the Asiatic Society of Bengal in Kolkata
            (Calcutta), India, in 1814. The founder curator was Nathaniel Wallich, a Danish botanist.

            It has six sections comprising thirty five galleries of cultural and scientific artifacts namely Indian art,
            archaeology, anthropology, geology, zoology and economic botany. Many rare and unique specimens, both Indian
            and trans-Indian, relating to humanities and natural sciences, are preserved and displayed in the galleries
            of these sections. In particular the art and archaeology sections hold collections of international
            importance.

            It is an autonomous organization under the Ministry of Culture, Government of India. The present Director of
            the Indian Museum is Shri Arijit Dutta Choudhury who is also the Director General, NCSM and having the
            additional charge of Director General of National Library.

          <h1>HISTORY</h1>
          <p>
            The Indian Museum originated from the Asiatic Society of Bengal which was created by Sir William Jones in
            1784. The concept of having a museum arose in 1796 from members of the Asiatic Society as a place where
            man-made and natural objects collected could be kept, cared for and displayed.

            The objective began to look achievable in 1808 when the Society was offered suitable accommodation by the
            Government of India in the Chowringhee-Park Street area.[11]

            On February 2, 1814, Nathaniel Wallich, a Danish botanist, who had been captured in the siege of Serampore
            but later released, wrote to the council of the Asiatic Society for the formation of a museum out of his own
            collection and that of the Asiatic Society in Calcutta, volunteering his service as a Curator wherein he
            proposed five sectionsâ€”an archaeological, ethnological, a technical section and a geological and zoological
            one.[12] The council readily agreed and the Museum was created, with Wallich named the Honorary Curator and
            then Superintendent of the Oriental Museum of the Asiatic Society. Wallich also donated a number of
            botanical specimens to the museum from his personal collection. In 1815, Mr William Lloyd Gibbons, Asst
            Secretary and Librarian, was appointed Joint Secretary of the Museum.
            After the resignation of Wallich, curators were paid salaries by the Asiatic Society ranging from Rs 50 to
            Rs 200 a month. However, in 1836, when the bankers of the Asiatic Society (Palmer and Company) became
            insolvent, the Government began to pay the salary of the Curator from its public funds since a large part of
            the collection was that of the surveyors of Survey of India.

            A temporary grant of Rs 200 per month was sanctioned for maintenance of the museum and library, and J. T.
            Pearson of the Bengal Medical Service was appointed curator, followed shortly by John McClelland and, after
            the former's resignation, by Edward Blyth.

            In 1840, the Government took a keen interest in geology and mineral resources, and this led to an additional
            grant of Rs 250 per month for the geological section alone. In 1851 when the Geological Survey of India came
            into being with the advent of Sir Thomas Oldham, a rented building at 1, Hastings Road now K N Roy Road, the
            present site of the New Secretariat became its office. The geological collection of the Government of India
            'Museum of Economic Geology' at the Asiatic Society, were then transferred to this site in 1856. The Asiatic
            Society geological collection were however held back with the condition that it would be handed over to the
            GSI once a Museum for all its collection came into being. It was way back in 1837 that Sir James Princeps,
            then-Secretary of the Asiatic Society, had written to the Government asking for a Museum paid for by the
            state. A movement for a full-fledged Museum was thereafter keenly pursued over a decade, and later, with Sir
            Thomas Oldham, then Superintendent of the Geological Survey of India, at the helm, it gained momentum.
            The thrust for a full-fledged Museum was held up due to the intervention of the revolt of the sepoys of the
            East India Company. The matter was pursued again, once things settled down after India came under the Crown.

            Thereafter the First Indian Museum Act was passed in 1866 and the foundation of the Indian Museum at its
            present site laid in 1867. In 1875 the present building on Chowringee Road, presently Jawaharlal Nehru Road,
            designed by W L Granville in consultation with Sir Thomas Holland, on Chowringee was completed. In 1877
            after the retirement of Sir Thomas Oldham in 1876 the Geological Survey of India including the Museum of
            Economic Geology shifted here from its rented accommodation on 1 Hastings Road.

            This building had been designated as the site for not just the Asiatic Societies, Oriental Museum's
            collection and the Economic Geology collection of the Geological Survey of India but also to hold the
            offices of both.

            The Asiatic Society however relinquished its rights preferring to maintain its autonomy from the government.
            The Geological Survey of India is till date headquartered at the buildings of the Indian Museum Complex and
            holds exclusive rights over the Geological galleries of the Indian Museum.

            The building parallel to Sudder Street commenced in 1888 and occupied in 1891. The next building block at
            right angle to Sudder Street was erected in 1894. Half of this building was consigned to the Geological
            Survey of India but by 1912 it was wholly transferred to it.

            The Zoological and Anthropological sections of the museum gave rise to the Zoological Survey of India in
            1916, which in turn gave rise to the Anthropological Survey of India in 1945.[13]

            The Scottish anatomist and zoologist John Anderson took up the position of curator in 1865, and catalogued
            the mammal and archaeology collections. The English zoologist James Wood-Mason worked at the museum from
            1869 and succeeded Anderson as curator in 1887.[14]

            The museum was closed to visitors for restoration and upgrades from September 2013 to February 2014

            <h4>INDIAN</h4>
            <p>
              The large collection of ancient and medieval Indian artifacts include the complete railings and gateways
              of the Buddhist stupa from Bharhut (the bare stupa is still at Bharhut, near Satna, MP). The Bharhut
              panels are unique in that they are inscribed in the Brahmi script. The museum has a collection of the
              remains of the slightly later Amaravati Stupa. There is a large and representative collection of Buddhist
              and Hindu sculptures of the medieval period, especially those from Bengal, Bihar, and Odisha.

              Also preserved are Buddha's relics, a copy of the Lion Capital of Ashoka from an Ashoka pillar (original
              in the Sarnath Museum) whose four-lion symbol became the official emblem of the Republic of India, fossil
              skeletons of prehistoric animals, an art collection, rare antiques, and a collection of meteorites.

              The Indian Museum is also regarded as "the beginning of a significant epoch initiating the socio-cultural
              and scientific achievements of the country. It is otherwise considered as the beginning of the modernity
              and the end of medieval era"
